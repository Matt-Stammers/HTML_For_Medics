An Introduction to HTML For Clinician Developers

If you want to get started with learning Frontend (or the visibile part of the web) development then HTML is the best place to start. Whilst it is not a programming language, it will get you up and running fast in terms of being able to deploy content to your web browser - (that's what HTML does - it deploys content to your browser).

Before you get started I recommend you download the Atom text editor: https://atom.io/ as it is definitely the best frontend coding environment I have found (and I have tried out a LOT of them!)

I also recommend the following resources:
  - Sololearn App - www.sololearn.com
  - Codeacademy - www.codeacademy.com
  - Many of the courses on Udemy / Udacity / or any of the other major platforms are very good, but don't pay for one to learn HTML     alone, it won't be worth the money.

A note of advice: be patient with yourself, it takes time especially when working full time as a doctor. It took me months to get going, but trust me it is well worth it and you will never regret the investment you made in yourself ;)
