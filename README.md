An Introduction to HTML For Clinician Developers

If you want to get started with learning Frontend development then HTML is the best place to start.

I recommend the following resources:
  - Sololearn App - www.sololearn.com
  - Codeacademy - www.codeacademy.com
  - Many of the courses on Udemy / Udacity / or any of the other major platforms are very good, but don't pay for one to learn HTML     alone, it won't be worth the money.
